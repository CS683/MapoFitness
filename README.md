# Overview 

> The application I want to develop is a fitness and nutrition apps.

# Related Work

> (*This section should describe some similar applications that you find
> through online research. It should describe the similarities and
> differences between your application and those applications.
> <span class="mark">This section should be completed in iteration 0 as
> part of your proposal. It can be modified in later iterations</span>*)

# Requirement Analysis and Testing

> (*This section should clearly describe all features/requirements that
> you plan to implement or have implemented for your application. You
> should separate them into three categories: essential, desirable and
> optional.*

*For each requirement/feature, you should provide the following
details:*

|                                              |     |
|----------------------------------------------|-----|
| *<span class="mark">Title</span>*            |     |
| *<span class="mark">Description</span>*      |     |
| *<span class="mark">Mockups</span>*          |     |
| *<span class="mark">Acceptance tests</span>* |     |
| *Test Results*                               |     |
| *Status*                                     |     |

*For example:*

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 19%" />
<col style="width: 80%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>Title (Essential/Desirable/Optional)</em></td>
<td><em>View project details (Essential)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>Description</em></td>
<td><em>As a user, I want to view the details of a project so that I can
have a better idea about that project.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>Mockups</em></td>
<td><em>You can put one or more mockups here.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>Acceptance tests</em></td>
<td><p><em>Given a project list is shown on the screen,</em></p>
<p><em>When the user clicks on one project on the list</em></p>
<p><em>Then the project details will be displayed on the screen,
including project title, brief description, implementation stack,
authors, keywords, project links, etc.</em></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>Test Results</em></td>
<td><em>You can provide some screenshots of the execution
result.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>Status</em></td>
<td><p><em>Iteration 1: implemented the project detail UI page</em></p>
<p><em>Iteration 2: Implemented User click event</em></p>
<p><em>Iteration 3: Implemented project database.
Completed.</em></p></td>
</tr>

> *<span class="mark">In Iteration 0 (project planning phase), this
> section should contain most essential features, some desirable
> features and possibly a few optional features if you want. Each
> feature listed in this section should have a <u>title</u> and a
> <u>brief description</u>, preferably using the user story template “As
> (a role)… I want (some feature), so that (value)...” . Each essential
> feature should also have at least one <u>acceptance test</u>, and one
> or multiple mockups if applicable.</span>*

> *<span class="mark">(In later iterations (iteration 1 to 3), this
> section should be updated to reflect your progress. In particular,
> make sure to update the status row of each requirement. Highlight each
> feature/requirement that you work on in the current iteration, you
> should also provide some test results if it is completed or partially
> completed.)</span>*

# Design and Implementation

> (*This section should describe the basic architecture (e.g. MVC, or
> MVVM) and your detailed design and implementation. This section may
> contain the following aspects:*

- *Basic architecture*

- *UI design and implementation*

  - *Activities, fragments, special widgets, etc*

- *Other android features*

  - *Service, sensors, animations, etc*

- *Third party APIs*

- *Data Design and implementation*

  - *Database schema, data storage*

- *Algorithms*

- *…*

> *<span class="mark">In iteration 0, you can provide an overview or
> simply list some basic implementation features.</span>*
>
> <span class="mark">*In later iterations, this section should be
> updated to provide detailed explanation on how you implement your
> requirements. You shall provide some explanation as well as supporting
> evidence, such as sample code snippets (or the file name and line
> numbers of code. In particular, if you used any features that are not
> discussed in the class, provide a detailed explanation here.* )</span>

# Project Structure

> (*Please provide a screenshot(s) of your current project structure,
> which should show all the packages, kotlin/java files and resource
> files in your project. You should also <u>highlight any files/packages
> you have changed, added/deleted in this iteration compared with the
> previous iteration</u>. <span class="mark">This is not needed for
> iteration 0</span>*)

# Timeline

> (*Please provide a summary of the requirements implemented and
> Android/third party components used in the past and current
> iterations, and the plan in the future iteration.
> <span class="mark">This is needed for every iteration including
> iteration 0.</span> In your iteration 0, you will give a plan for all
> future iterations. In later iterations, you shall update it according
> to your progress such as describe what you have implemented in current
> iteration and modify the future iteration plan accordingly. The last
> two columns on the right are only needed if your project is a group
> project. <span class="mark"></span>*)

# Future Work (Optional)

> (*This section can describe possible future works. Particularly the
> requirements you planned but didn’t get time to implement, and
> possible Android components or features to implement them.*
>
> *This section is optional, and you can include this section in the
> final iteration if you want.*)

# Project Demo Links

> (*For on campus students, we will have project presentations in class.
> <span class="mark">For online students, you are required to submit a
> video of your project presentation which includes a demo of your app
> and explanation of your implementation.</span> You can use Kaltura or
> zoom or any video tool to make the video and then submit it on
> blackboard. Please check the following link for the details of using
> Kaltura to make and submit videos on blackboard. You can also use
> other video tools and upload your video to youtube if you like:
